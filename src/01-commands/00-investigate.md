# Investigating the repository

There are a few commands that one can use to investigate a repository. The most important ones are:

* `git log` (covered in `Git 101` course)
* `git show` (covered in `Git 101` course)
* `git grep`
* `git bisect`
* `git blame`
* `git diff` and `git range-diff`

This chapter will not cover `git log` and `git show` as they were already covered in the `Git 101` course.
