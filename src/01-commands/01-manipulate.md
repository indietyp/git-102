# Manipulating the Git History

There are a few commands that one can use to manipulate the git history. The most important ones are:
* `git commit --amend`
* `git rebase`
* `git reset`
* `git revert`
* `git cherry-pick`
* `git squash`

This chapter will not cover `git rebase` as it is already covered in the [Merging and Rebasing](../01-commands/02-merging-and-rebasing.md) chapter.
