# GitLab

This section covers the GitLab specific features, that are not part of Git itself. If you are not using GitLab, you can
skip this section, but most of the sections are written in a way that they can be applied to other Git hosting services
as well.

Git hosting platforms like GitLab are quite complex and vast, and it is impossible to cover all features in this course.
This is why only a fraction of features is covered here. If you are interested in learning more about GitLab, you can
check out the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/README.html).

The features discussed here are:

* [Merge Requests](00-merge-request.md)
* [Issues](01-issues.md)
* [Forks](02-forks.md)
* [Releases](03-releases.md)
