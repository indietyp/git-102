# Issues

Issues are a way to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs.

They are not part of Git, they are a feature of various Git hosting services like GitLab and GitHub.

While originally designed for software development, issues are a great way to track any kind of task. You can use them
to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs.

To help with organization, issues can be assigned to people, labeled, and put into milestones. They can also be linked
to other issues and merge requests.

You can reference issues in commit messages and merge requests by using the `#` symbol followed by the issue number,
e.g. `#1`. This will create two way links between the issue and the commit/merge request, which is useful for tracking
the progress.

The workflow is typically as follows:

1. Create an issue
2. Assign the issue to someone (otherwise it will be unassigned, and there is a higher probability that it might go
   stale)
3. The assignee works on the issue
4. The assignee creates a merge request to resolve the issue
5. The merge request is reviewed and merged
6. The issue is closed

Some projects require that each merge request is accompanied by an issue, but that isn't always the case, as the
use-cases vary widely.

> A stale issue is an issue that has not been updated for a long time. It is a good idea to revisit all issues present
> in a repository from time to time to make sure that they are still relevant. Ones that are stale and no longer
> relevant should be closed.

## Exercise

### Tasks

1. Create a new issue in the repository, the title and purpose of the issue is up to you.

   Here are some ideas:
    * Create an issue to track your progress in this course
    * Create an issue with comments about the course, what can be improved
    * Create an issue with all your questions about Git (and you can try to answer them yourself, or record answers from
      the instructor)
    * Create an issue with a list of all the things you have learned in this course
    * Create an issue with non-sense, e.g. a list of your favorite foods, or a list of your favorite movies, try to have
      fun with it!

   Try to use this assignment as an opportunity to explore the issue tracker and learn about the different features.

2. Assign the issue to yourself.

3. Add a label to the issue.

4. Add a milestone to the issue. (use the milestone for this course)

5. Explore the issues in the repository, choose one that you find appealing (maybe the one from your neighbour) and
   comment on it. (you can also comment on your own issue)

6. Close the issue once you think you're done with it. (if it is after the course is over, then that is also fine)

   Issues that are not closed in a week from now will be closed automatically.
